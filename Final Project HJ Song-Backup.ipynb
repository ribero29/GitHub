      "  * <b>min_samples_leaf</b>: The minimum number of samples in newly created leaves.Try [1, 2, 3]. If 3 is the best, try higher numbers such as 1 through 10.\n",

      "  * <b>n_jobs</b>: Determines if multiple processors should be used to train and test the model. Always set this to -1 and %%timeit vs. if it is set to 1. It should be much faster (especially when many trees are trained)."
